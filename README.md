/*
 * Program: Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
 * Author: Albion Berisha
 *
 * Description:
 * This program provides a visual demonstration of multiple sorting algorithms
 * (e.g., Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Tim Sort, Radix Sort, Gnome Sort).
 * Each algorithm is animated step-by-step, with bars representing array elements
 * and colors highlighting comparisons, swaps, and sorted sections.
 *
 * Usage:
 * 1. Launch the application.
 * 2. Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
 * 3. Press "Start" to begin the visualization.
 * 4. Use the speed slider to adjust animation speed in real time.
 * 5. Observe the legend for color meanings:
 *      - Blue: Default unsorted elements
 *      - Magenta/Cyan/Orange: Active comparisons depending on algorithm
 *      - Green: Sorted section
 * 6. The log panel will display textual updates for each step.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - Each algorithm runs incrementally on a timer, so you can follow the process visually.
 * - The program is designed for educational purposes, helping users understand
 *   how different sorting algorithms operate internally.
