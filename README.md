Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

Author: Albion Berisha


This project is an interactive application designed to visually demonstrate how different sorting algorithms work.


It animates each algorithm step by step, showing how elements are compared, swapped, and gradually arranged into a sorted sequence.


The goal is to make algorithm behavior intuitive and easy to understand through both visual and textual feedback.


--How to Use


After launching the application, select a sorting algorithm from the menu and press Start to begin the visualization.


The bars on the screen represent array elements, and their colors change dynamically to indicate the algorithm’s progress:


- Blue represents unsorted elements.

  
- Magenta / Cyan / Orange highlight active comparisons depending on the algorithm.

  
- Green indicates elements that have reached their final sorted position.

  
You can adjust the animation speed in real time using the slider control. 


A legend is provided to explain the meaning of each color, and a log panel records each step of the algorithm for additional clarity.


--Purpose


This program is intended for educational use.


It helps students, developers, and enthusiasts gain a deeper understanding of sorting algorithms by combining visual animation with textual explanations.


By observing the process step by step, users can see not only the final result but also the mechanics behind each algorithm.
